  Language Officer Information
</h1>

<p>Language Officers are election officers, who in addition to performing all regular officer duties, may also assist voters in a language other than English.</p>

<p>Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act generally requires jurisdictions to provide language assistance to voters if more than 5% of voting-age citizens are members of a single-language minority group. In Fairfax County, we always assign Language Officers for <strong>Spanish</strong>, <strong>Vietnamese</strong>, and <strong>Korean</strong> in needed precincts. When possible, we also try to assign Language Officers in <strong>Chinese</strong>, <strong>Arabic</strong>, <strong>Farsi</strong>, <strong>Hindi</strong>, <strong>Urdu</strong>, <strong>Russian</strong>, and <strong>ASL</strong> in needed precincts.</p>

<p>To qualify as a Language Officer, an individual must pass an oral language skills assessment. We then assign Language Officers to precincts based on US Census data and voter feedback. About one-third of our precincts are assigned at least one Language Officer.</p>

<p>Additional notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language Officers are assigned every election, regardless of their party affiliation. For other officers, we must consider their party affiliation when making precinct assignments (e.g. in a single-party Democratic primary, we generally only assign Democratic officers).</li>
  <li>Language Officers are assigned before other officers.</li>
  <li>Language Officers must fluently speak English, in addition to their other language.</li>
  <li>Language officers will receive and wear a special name badge on election day which identifies them as a Language Officer and the language they speak.</li>
  <li>Language Officers receive the same stipend as regular officers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="language-officer-referral-bonus">Language Officer Referral Bonus</h2>

<p>Beginning with the June 2022 election, we are offering a language officer referral bonus for two languages: <strong>Vietnamese</strong> and <strong>Korean</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are a new or existing officer and refer someone who successfully serves as a Language Officer in one of these languages, you are eligible to receive a <span>$25</span> bonus stipend.</p>

<p>The new Language Officer receives the standard election officer stipend of <span>$175</span>.</p>

<p><strong>WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE REFERRAL BONUS?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Current and new Fairfax County election officers.</li>
  <li>Any election officer may receive the bonus, even if they are not assigned or do not serve in the next election.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHEN IS THE REFERRAL BONUS PAID</strong>?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The bonus will be paid with all other stipends, about 4-6 weeks after each election.</li>
  <li>A referring officer may earn a <span>$25</span> bonus for each new Language Officer they refer. For example, if someone refers 3 new Language Officers who meet all requirements, they would receive a <span>$75</span> bonus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REFERRAL BONUS TO BE EARNED?</strong></p>

<p>The referring officer must…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recruit an eligible person who has never previously applied or served as an officer in Fairfax County that would meet a specific and previously identified language need.</li>
  <li>Instruct the eligible person how to apply, making sure that they include the full name of the referring officer in their application.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new Language Officer must…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be a currently registered Virginia voter.</li>
  <li>Submit the online <a href="https://www.vote4fairfax.com/apply/">election officer application</a>. <strong>In the Comments section, make sure to put the full name of the person who referred you!</strong></li>
  <li>Pass an oral language skills assessment in-person or by telephone.</li>
  <li>Schedule and attend an in-person hiring paperwork appointment.</li>
  <li>Complete all training requirements for the next scheduled Fairfax County election.</li>
  <li>Serve in the next scheduled election as a Language Officer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE EXAMPLES OF WHY A BONUS IS NOT EARNED AND PAID?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The new Language Officer is not a registered voter or does not meet the requirements to be an election officer.</li>
  <li>The new Language Officer does not fluently speak English, in addition to their second language.</li>
  <li>The new Language Officer does not pass the language skills assessment.</li>
  <li>The new Language Officer does not provide the name of the individual who referred them, either in their online application or within a short but reasonable period time afterwards (e.g. one week).</li>
  <li>The new Language Officer does not complete training in a timely manner.</li>
  <li>The new Language Officer cancels their assignment for any reason, does not serve for their full shift, or asks to change positions.</li>
</ul>
