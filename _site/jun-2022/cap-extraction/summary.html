        <!-- <p><strong>001. : Pre-Processing Phase 1 - Opening/Extraction</strong></p> -->

        <p>Welcome to the Fairfax County Office of Elections Absentee Ballot online training course for Pre-Processing Phase 1, Opening and Extraction. As the name implies, this first phase involves the the opening of the voter’s returned mailer and extraction of its enclosed ballot. This course will familiarize the user with the steps involved in processing these return mailers.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>002. : First, some background...</strong></p> -->

        <p>First, some background on how a voter can vote absentee. If a voter wishes to vote absentee, their first step is to submit, in writing, an absentee ballot application to the Fairfax County Office of Elections. The application must be mailed, emailed, or submitted through the Department of Elections online portal. An absentee ballot cannot be requested by telephone. When a voter’s request is approved, an absentee ballot is sent to the requester within three business days once ballots have been printed.</p>

<p>After the voter receives and votes their ballot, they return it to the Office of Elections inside a sealed return mailer by various methods including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>United States Postal Service (USPS)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commercial mail delivery service such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Placed in a drop box at early voting locations during operating hours</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 24/7 drop box located outside the Fairfax County Government Center</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On election day, placed in a drop box at a polling place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hand delivered to Fairfax County Office of Elections, Suite 323</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>003. : At the Office of Elections...</strong></p> -->

        <p>Now that the return mailer has been received at the office of elections, its real journey begins. Within the office, the return mailer (with its enclosed absentee ballot) will be categorized, counted, date stamped, bundled, and a tracking log created as part of the Mail Receipt process. From there, the mailers move on to the next operation, which is Mail Check-in. This team is responsible for updating the return mailer’s status in Virginia’s statewide voter database, whish is known as VERIS. During that process, the mailer status transitions from “issued” (which is an absentee ballot sent to voter), to “pre-processed” (which means the absentee ballot has been returned, Statement of Absentee Voter completed, with required signatures included). Once the Mail Check-in process has been completed, the return mailers cycle forward to Extraction team leads who organize the return mailers for pre-processing.</p>

<p>The first step in preparing the now bundled return mailers is to have them made into “batches”. Batching is the process of combining the bundled return mailers into larger groups which average between 700-900 mailers. When the batch is created, a ballot batch tracking log is generated. The original bundle logs, prepared when the return mailer was first received in the office, are attached to the newly created ballot batch tracking log. The batch log (with the associated bundle logs attached) remains with that batch of return mailers throughout the rest of the processing cycle.</p>

<p>The batched return mailers are now ready for the next step, which is Pre-Processing Phase One, the actual Opening and Extraction.</p>

        <p>The first phase of pre-processing is a two-step operation. Step one is the physical opening of the return mailer with step two being the removal of its enclosed ballot.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>005. : Step 1 - Opening</strong></p> -->

        <p>Pre-processing phase 1, step 1 begins: the opening. The batched return mailers are kept in secure storage until it’s time for the first step of pre-processing phase 1. A team of two election office staff transport to the work area only the number of batched return mailers that can be processed by extraction teams by the end of each workday.</p>

<p>The opening team uses the automatic envelope opening machine (Omation 360), taking care to ensure the enclosed ballot is not damaged. The opening team opens all return mailers in one batch before opening the next batch. Once the workday’s batches of return mailers are opened, they’re ready for step 2, which is actual ballot extraction.</p>

        <p>Pre-processing, phase 1, step 2: extraction. Now that the day’s batches of return mailers have been opened, it’s time to remove, or extract, the enclosed folded ballot from its mailer.</p>

<p>Extraction is done by teams of 2-4 people with one person designated as the table team leader. Team member duties include removing folded ballots from their mailers, identification and proper handling of damaged ballots, accurate accounting of ballots and return mailers, and preparing ballots for scan team processing. A team member is also responsible for notifying their team leader when they come across what is known as a faulty return mailer. A faulty return mailer is one in which the contents are not as they should be. Examples include no ballot or an empty mailer, a mailer with two or more ballots in it, or a mailer that contains only election information materials but no ballot. When this happens, the team member notifies their table team leader. The team leader notifies the Extraction Operation Supervisor who removes the faulty return mailer from the batch, directs the team leader to adjust their batch count, and forwards the faulty mailer to the Curing team.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>007. : Extraction – Step by step</strong></p> -->

        <p>Now that you’ve had an overview of the extraction process, let’s go step by step. When extraction teams are ready, the Extraction Operation Supervisor places one batch of opened return mailers on each table. A batch averages 700-900 mailers contained in approximately 1-2 yellow trays.</p>

<p>From the tray, each team member takes a handful of return mailers and places the stack in front of them. Taking one mailer at a time, the folded ballot is removed from its return mailer. The still folded ballot is then placed into the box marked “ballots” and the empty return mailer placed in the box marked “mailer”. These 2 boxes are located on your tabletop. Periodically, you’ll come across a ballot that is badly stained, torn or crumpled, missing timing marks, and so on. These ballots are considered damaged and cannot be automatically counted or scanned by the DS850. They are known as non-scannable and are placed in a black tray on top of the worktable. These non-scannable ballots will be counted by hand after the polls close on election day. This extraction process continues until the team’s batch tray is empty. Please remember, all extraction work is conducted on the tabletop. Return mailers and ballots must be always visible.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>008. : Extraction – Time to count</strong></p> -->

        <p>Once the table’s batch tray is empty, each team member counts their stacks of folded ballots and return mailers.</p>

<p>Ballots and empty return mailers are counted separately, in groups of ten, crisscrossing each group of ten to create stacks of 50. The ballots are kept folded.</p>

<p>Once counts are completed, the numbers must be verified by a second person at the table. The stacks of folded ballots and return mailers remain in place. Team members physically switch to another seat at the table and count the stacks of ballots and return mailers in front of that seat. The first person’s count must match the second person’s count. If the counts do not match, the stacks are counted again until they do match. Counts must agree before moving on. After counts agree, ballots are unfolded and boxed, and mailers bundled in preparation for review by the Quality Assurance team.</p>

        <p><strong>009. <a href="/jun-2022/cap-extraction/slides/009">Step 2 - Prep for QA</a></strong></p>
        

        <!-- <p><strong>009. : Step 2 - Prep for QA</strong></p> -->

        <p>In preparing the ballots and mailers for QA review, several actions are necessary.</p>

<p>First, each team member takes their stacks of 50 empty return mailers, rubber bands each one, and puts them back into the yellow trays on the table.</p>

<p>Next, the ballots are unfolded. When unfolding, the ballot is placed with the office races facing down on the table, maintaining the stacks of 50 ballots. While you’re unfolding the ballot, take small groups of about 10 at a time and gently roll the ballots lengthwise. This action flattens and helps to “nest” the ballots making them easier to be scanned by the DS 850. As you continue to unfold and flatten the ballots, make sure they are facing in the same direction.</p>

<p>During the unfolding and stacking process, you may come across paper tabs at the top of some ballots. These tabs are a leftover from the printer and must be removed as they can cause problems during the scanning process. Once all your ballots are unfolded, give any stacks of less than 50 to the team leader who will consolidate those ballots into a final stack. If this final stack is still less than 50, the team leader will put a sticky note on it saying how many ballots are in that last stack.</p>

<p>Now that all ballots at the table have been unfolded, flattened and nested, the table team leader loads up the batch box. First in are the stacks of scannable ballots, face down. A colored piece of paper is inserted between each stack as a help to the scan team. Next is the completed ballot batch tracking log and then any non-scannable/damaged ballots. So, your order of materials in the batch box should be: scannable ballots (face down) on the bottom, completed team batch log in the middle, with non-scannable/damaged ballots at the top. The batch box is now ready for review by the Quality Assurance team.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>010. : Extraction – QA review</strong></p> -->

        <p>The QA team is now in charge! To start, the team takes the table’s yellow trays of bundled return mailers and the batch box to their work area. Step one, they’ll put the bundled return mailers in to a #5 box, take a batch number label from one of the yellows tray and put it on the side of the #5 box. Step one done!</p>

<p>Step two is verification of the batch box contents. Ballots stacked face down, check. Paper tabs removed, check. Ballot batch tracking log completed, check. Damaged/non-scannable ballots on top of the log, check. Step two done!</p>

<p>Step three consists of QA specific actions: two blue batch box labels pre-printed with the corresponding batch number put inside; second batch number taken from the other yellow tray and placed on the outside of the box; box sealed with black security tape; each QA team member signs across the security tape. Step three done!</p>

<p>Once all QA actions have been completed, the team enters the required information on the “opening and extraction operation master log”.</p>
