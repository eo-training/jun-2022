  Chief and Assistant Chief Information
</h1>

<p>Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs work hand-in-hand to manage one of our voting precincts on election day and supervise 5 to 15 election officers, depending on precinct and election size. Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must complete training and other requirements before each election in which they serve as a Chief or Assistant Chief.</p>

<h3 id="compensation">Compensation</h3>

<p>For each election, Chiefs are paid <span>$</span>250, Assistant Chiefs are paid <span>$</span>225, and regular officers are paid <span>$</span>175.</p>

<p>NEW: As of June 2022, Chiefs also receive an additional stipend of <span>$</span>20 for some required travel (<span>$</span>10 for picking up important materials before election day and <span>$</span>10 for returning materials on election night).</p>

<h3 id="party-representation">Party Representation</h3>

<p>Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs are assigned from qualified election officers representing the two political parties having the largest number of votes for Governor in the last gubernatorial election. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, this is usually the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>

<p>In general elections, in accordance with the Code of Virginia and Electoral Board policy, Chiefs represent the party of the current sitting Governor and Assistant Chiefs represent the next largest party.</p>

<p>In single-party primary elections, in accordance with the Code of Virginia and Electoral Board policy, the Chief and the Assistant Chief should represent the party conducting the primary, if practicable.</p>

<h3 id="impartiality-and-responsiveness">Impartiality and Responsiveness</h3>

<p>Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must demonstrate impartiality in all dealings with voters, election officers, and the Office of Elections.</p>

<p>Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must respond in a timely manner to all communications from the Office of Elections or election officers before election day.</p>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>

<p>Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must both fulfill the same training requirements.</p>

<p>In addition to any regular officer training, Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must complete a <em>Chiefs Briefing</em> training class the week before <em>each election</em> in which they serve as a Chief or Assistant Chief.</p>

<p>First-time Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs are also required to complete the <em>Chief &amp; Assistant Chief Basics</em> training class before being eligible to serve in these roles for the first time.</p>

<h3 id="other-requirements">Other Requirements</h3>

<p>In addition to training, Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs have additional requirements before election day.</p>

<p>Chiefs are also required to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete all pre-election duties by certain deadlines</li>
  <li>Pick up election materials from our office the week before election day</li>
  <li>Review Chiefs Notebook and other election materials the week before election day</li>

  <li>Visit polling place the day before election day to setup voting room, if possible</li>
  <li>After polls close and all work is complete on election day, drive some election materials to one of 3 designated locations around the county</li>
